This directory contains re-evaluations of our best-fit models from two
scenarios, the continuous migration model and the multiple merger model (each
with migration between stem populations). These refit models correspond to the
supplemenary results (Section 7.1), and are organized into sub-directories for
each validation scenario.

Models are given in Demes format (Gower et al., 2022; doi:
https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.31.494112).

YRI_CEU: Fits replacing MSL with YRI and GBR with CEU.

TSI: Fits replacing GBR with TSI.

Nama_map: Fits using statistics computed from a Nama-specific recombination map.

Nama_thresholds: Fits using a subset of Nama individuals, based on minimum
estimated ancestry proportions (90% and 99%).

deeper_fixed_divergences: Fits with the OOA event fixed at 60ka intsead of 50ka,
and the E/W African split fixed at 100ka instead of 60ka.

relaxed_divergences: Fits allowing the OOA and E/W African split times to be
fit.
