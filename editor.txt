Dear editor, 

We are pleased to submit our manuscript "A weakly structured stem for human origins in Africa" for publication. 
Many genetic studies have recently transformed our view of early human history using genetic data to identify unexpected patterns in our history. 
However, studies that have looked at early human history share important limitations. They typically rely on very limited data, focus on very specific aspects of
genetic diversity to infer past events, and only consider a narrow range of possible models to explain these data. 

In this manuscript, we introduce new whole-genome sequence data from the Nama, a south African population that is deeply diverged from most other modern groups. 
Using a recently developed approach, 
we test a wide range of competing models from the anthropological and genetics literature against worldwide 
genetic diversity patterns.

Our analyses strongly 
support a model involving weak population structure in humans dating back to a million years ago. This is in stark contrast to
models currently favoured among geneticists, which feature a single recent ancestral population with archaic contributions in Africa. 
In particular, it excludes many fossil remains as representing branches that contributed appreciably to modern humans. 

Because our analysis provides detailed quantitative  
models of human evolution, we were able to test it against a broader range of 
genetic and paleoanthropological information than qualitative models typically inferred using ancient genomes. 
We show that the weakly structured stem models outperform previously proposed models
in predicting a wide array of diversity patterns that had been previously attributed to archaic admixture. 
We also find that it better aligns with the archaelogical records, in that [...]

Our manuscript thus establishes a weakly structured stem model as the best-supported model to understand human
 origins and to describe genomic data.  

Sincerely, 

The authors.
